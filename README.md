# PurpPad - The purple Sketchpad
###*Harry Maher*

This is a simple 'sketch pad' made up of divs. Another project for the Odin Project!
Project instructions here: http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/javascript-and-jquery


###Instructions

Clone this repo:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/HarryMaher/sketchpad
```
Open index.html in your browser. 
Use your mouse to "draw" on the div elements in the center box.
Click "Random Purples" to draw with random shades and values of purple - this is instead of random color, which just doesn't look good
Click "Purple" to reset the colors to purple if you've clicked "Random Colors"
Click "Resolution" to change the resolution of the pad - I set the max to 80 so less powerful computers won't crash.
Click "Clear" to clear the sketchpad.

Contact me with any questions!

####Note:
I got the color scheme from number 14 on  [this site](https://designschool.canva.com/blog/website-color-schemes/).
